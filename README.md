HI I am Khuram Hafeez.
I am a fullstack developer with a degree in Economics. I try to understand the depth of technology, combining my knowledge of economics and computer science to find problems and try to find solutions. My current research interest is "integrating price comparison with an automated purchasing system and designing a standard API through which consumers and e-commerce platforms can communicate". I believe that this topic has the potential to revolutionize E-commerce and other IT related industries.
