HI I am Khuram Hafeez. I am a fullstack developer with a degree in Economics. I try to understand the depth of technology, combining my knowledge of economics and computer science to find problems and try to find solutions. My current research interest is on a software that works for the user on the internet for multiple tasks such as purchasing, internet surfing, and many more for the user. I believe that this topic has the potential to revolutionize E-commerce and other IT related industries.
